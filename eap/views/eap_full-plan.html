        <h1 class="section_h1">General Information</h1>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Purpose</h2>
        <p>This Emergency Action Plan, hereafter referred to as the “Plan”, establishes policy, defines personnel responsibilities and provides guidance for the response to, mitigation of, and recovery from the potential consequences of an emergency situation occurring at The Northern California Sound and Communication JATC site in San Leandro, California. Emergency situations include significant accidents, incidents, events, or natural phenomena, which could seriously degrade the safety or security of the site. This Plan develops a framework for the development, implementation, and maintenance of an Emergency Plan relevant to activities/operations conducted at the JATC.  Situation-specific guidelines contained within this plan will provide facility personnel with the details of their duties and responsibilities during an emergency.</p>
        <p>This plan was developed using information from CAL-OSHA EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN Title 8 Section 3220 Fire Prevention Plan Title 8 Section 3221 to establish guides and procedures to mitigate the potential consequences of an emergency/disaster that threatens the health and safety of the JATC staff, students and visiting personnel. </p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Scope</h2>
        <p>This plan applies to all personnel temporarily or permanently assigned to or visiting the JATC facility in San Leandro California. This Plan addresses them JATC Emergency Management Program as it relates to potential emergencies that could arise at the JATC San Leandro site.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Concept of Operations</h2>
        <p>This JATC site will utilize an All-Hazards approach to emergency management based upon the identified hazards. The risk assessment process included the identification of potential hazards, including Natural hazards, Technological-caused hazards and Human-caused hazards. The likelihood of their occurrence and the vulnerability of people, property and the environment were also considered. The potential events that have been identified as the planning basis for this plan include, but are not limited to earthquakes, severe weather / power outages, structure fires, flooding, bomb threats, civil disorders, terrorist/Active intruder incidents. The JATC does not store hazardous chemicals over nationally recognized threshold planning quantities (TPQs).</p>
        <p>During emergency situations, the JATC concept of operations is based on centralized authority maintained by the JATC Emergency Coordinator with decentralized responsibilities coordinated through the facility staff and the Emergency Response Team members.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Program Advisory Committee</h2>
        <p>The Emergency Preparedness and Safety Committee is comprised of JATC staff and faculty members and chaired by the (TBD). The functions of the committee are to review on an ongoing basis current policy and practices, assess available resources for best practices, establish and document preparedness and response policies, and implement action/training plans for JATC staff.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It is recognized that the planning process must address each hazard that threatens the facility. This section summarizes major disaster threats to the City of San Leandro and the JATC.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Earthquake</h2>
        <p>The US Geological Survey has estimated a 62% probability of a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area by the year 2032.  The City of San Leandro lies near the Hayward Fault.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Extreme Weather</h2>
        <p>Extreme weather storms have traditionally affected the City of San Leandro in a variety of ways; however, none of these affects have been so severe as to affect the delivery of services to the students and partners.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Structure Fires</h2>
        <p>The facility is located in a commercial and light industrial area. The possibility of structure fires exists, but there is not a high level of probability.  However, these fires will impact this area (i.e. air quality, traffic access, and evacuation).</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Hazardous Materials</h2>
        <p>One of the primary hazards facing the City of San Leandro and the JATC would be an emergency involving the movement of hazardous materials.  TAP Plastics is one of those hazards.  In addition, there are number of trucks and railcars that are used to transport hazardous materials through the City which contributes to the possibility this type of event occurring.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Airport Incident</h2>
        <p>The facility is adjacent to the Oakland International Airport, located within the flight path of propeller and jet-propelled aircraft with fairly large passenger and cargo capacity.  In addition, a medical transportation helicopter service is located on the airfield.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Management of Emergency Action Plan</h2>
        <p>The Emergency Action Plan will be</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DEVELOPED</strong> by a team of the JATC staff</li>
            <li><strong>INITIATED</strong> by the leadership designee when conditions exist which warrant its execution</li>
            <li><strong>IMPLEMENTED</strong> by all JATC staff</li>
            <li><strong>REVIEWED</strong> at least annually</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Elements of Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Management</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Leadership</h3>
        <p>Leadership ensures that emergency preparedness will be a priority and that adequate resources will be allocated to create and implement in the site based plans.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Site Emergency Management Plan</h3>
        <p>The Site Emergency Management Plan includes team assignments, emergency numbers, protocols, and the five phases of emergency management:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Planning</li>
            <li>Mitigation</li>
            <li>Preparedness</li>
            <li>Response</li>
            <li>Recovery</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Site Emergency Teams</h3>
        <p>Site Emergency Teams of individuals with specific duties to perform in order to prepare for and respond to emergencies. The Site Emergency Teams develop the plan to meet individual site needs and implement the plan in the event of an emergency.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Communication Methods</h3>
        <p>Plans should have established lines of internal communication (within the facility) and external communication.  Plans should include provisions for after-hours communication (telephone tree), and alternate means if telephone lines are disabled.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Emergency Protocols</h3>
        <p>Emergency Protocols are step-by-step procedures to implement in the event of an emergency.  These are clear directives that may be implemented across a number of emergency situations. These actions include, but are not limited to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drop, Cover and Hold</li>
            <li>Evacuation</li>
            <li>Lockdown</li>
            <li>Shelter in Place</li>
            <li>Specialized actions (such as offsite evacuations)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Staff Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Staff personnel have a responsibility to building occupants, just as staff members will rely on emergency services to open blocked roads, repair utilities, perform rescue work, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Training</h3>
        <p>Training is important on three main levels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>General awareness training for all staff</li>
            <li>First Aid and CPR</li>
            <li>Team training to address specific emergency response or recovery activities</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Practice</h3>
        <p>Practicing the plan consists of drills and exercises, orientation for staff, etc.  It is generally recommended that practice begins with basic orientation and tabletop exercises prior to engaging in full-scale simulations or drills.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Personal Emergency Plans</h3>
        <p>Staff members should develop personal and family emergency response plans.  Each family should anticipate that a staff member may be required to remain at site following a catastrophic event.  Knowing that the family is prepared and can handle the situation will enable school staff to do their job more effective.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Revisions and Updates</h2>
        <p>This plan and its procedures will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emergency and disaster functions will be identified and pre-assigned before the beginning of the calendar year</li>
            <li>Response teams and contact information will be updated annually</li>
            <li>New personnel will be assigned to vacate staff positions</li>
            <li>All emergency preparedness training and drills will be documented</li>
            <li>All updates to the plan will be recorded</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <section id="section_mitigation" class="full-plan_section">
        
        <h1 class="section_h1">Mitigation</h1>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Mitigation Definition and Overview</h2>
        <p>Mitigation is defined as proactive action taken to reduce or eliminate the adverse effects of natural and man-made hazards on people and property.</p>
        <p>The goal of MITIGATION is to decrease or eliminate the need for response as opposed to simply increasing response capability.  Mitigation begins by conducting a site hazard assessment, which requires a self-appraisal of major areas effecting site safety.  These areas include geographic location of buildings, proximity of potential hazards such as waterways, availability of transportation for possible evacuation, structural integrity of buildings, etc.</p>

        <h3>Hazard vs Risk</h3>
        <p>The terms "hazard" and “risk" are often used interchangeably in the context of mitigation. Hazards and risks are identified through vulnerability analysis, consequence modeling, code/regulation compliance, quantitative risk assessment and historical data correlations.</p>
        <p>Risk is the product of potential consequences and the expected frequency of occurrence.   The basic concept of acceptable risk is the maximum level of damage to the building that can be tolerated, related to a realistic risk event scenario or probability.  Consequences may include death, serious injury, the extent of structural damage, monetary loss, interruption of use, or environmental impact.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Assessing and Addressing Hazards</h2>
        <p>Mitigation assesses and addresses the safety and integrity of the following types of hazards to minimize or prevent adverse impacts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facilities – window seals, HVAC systems, building structure</li>
            <li>Security – functioning locks, controlled access to the facility</li>
            <li>Threats – probability of natural disasters or accidents</li>
            <li>Site Environment – social climate on campus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resources used to assess and address hazards include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Existing safety plans</li>
            <li>Security and safety-related policies</li>
            <li>Floor plans of building</li>
            <li>Maps of local evacuation routes</li>
            <li>Site crime reports</li>
            <li>Known safety and security concerns</li>
            <li>Logs of police calls for service</li>
            <li>Student and staff handbooks</li>
            <li>Disciplinary files</li>
            <li>Local memos of safety concerns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Facilities</h3>
        Structural and non-structural measures can mitigate the effects of natural hazard incidents.
        <h4 class="section_h4">Structural Mitigation</h4>
        <p>Includes physical rectification and standards such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building codes</li>
            <li>Materials specifications</li>
            <li>Performance regulations for the construction of new buildings</li>

        <p>California’s frequency of earthquake activity has resulted in sophisticated seismic building codes for all buildings and special inspection requirements, enforced by the state, for school buildings.    <strong>Building codes establish the minimum standards for safety.</strong></p>
        <p>The construction of hazard-resistant structures is perhaps the most cost-effective mitigation measure.  Hazard mitigation in existing structures is generally more costly, but when carried out 
            effectively before a disaster, prevents loss of life, reduces damage and avoids the outlay of associated costs for response and recovery operations. 
            </p>

        <h4 class="section_h4">Non-Structural Mitigation</h4>
        <p>Typically concentrates on the securing of light fixtures to ceilings, installation of wind shutters, strapping or bolting generators to walls, and numerous other techniques to prevent injuries and allow for the continued use of the site.</p>
        <p>Site occupants are particularly vulnerable to non-structural damage.  Excessive sway in any building may cause damage to non-structural components such as hung lath and plaster ceilings, partitions, water pipes, ductwork, electrical conduits, and communication lines.   Storage units, filing cabinets and library shelving shift or fall if not properly braced.</p>
        <p>Although students and staff may duck under desks and be safe from falling objects, ceiling components that drop in hallways and stairs can make movement difficult, particularly if combined with power failure and loss of lights. Additional falling hazards that are common in sites are wall-mounted televisions or ceiling mounted projectors.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Security</h3>
        <p>A higher level of protection is appropriate for facilities that will enhance site recovery. A hazard assessment should assure that the site buildings have functioning locks and controlled access.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Threats</h3>
        <p>Mitigation requires assessment of local threats, including the probability of industrial accidents and natural disasters.  Threat assessment considers potential hazards in the neighborhood such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High voltage power lines</li>
            <li>Facilities containing toxic, chemically reactive and/or radioactive materials</li>
            <li>Transportation routes of trucks and trains carrying hazardous materials</li>
            <li>Underground gas and oil pipelines</li>
            <li>Underground utility vaults</li>
            <li>Above-ground transformers</li>
            <li>Multi-story buildings vulnerable to damage or collapse</li>
            <li>Water towers and tanks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since location is a key factor in determining the risks associated with natural hazards, land use plans are a valuable tool in identifying areas that are most vulnerable to the impacts of natural hazards such as wildfires, earthquakes and flooding.</p>

        <h4 class="section_h4">Earthquake</h4>
        <p>A simple seismic evaluation that focuses specifically on educational facilities is rapid visual screening.  This method is intended as an initial step in identifying hazardous buildings and their deficiencies.  It is most useful for large school districts by providing an economical preliminary evaluation of the seismic risks, thereby reducing the number of buildings that require a more detailed evaluation by a structural engineer.</p>
        <p>The visual survey of a building can be completed in less than 30 minutes and can be accomplished from the street without benefit of entry into a building.  However, hazardous details may not be visible and seismically dangerous structures may not be identified as such.   Nonstructural interior components are not evaluated.</p>

        <h4 class="section_h4">Fire</h4>
        <p>Of the many hazards that can endanger an educational facility and its service to the community, the most prevalent is fire.  Design against fire has long been built into state building codes, in the form of approved materials, fire-resistant assemblies, exiting requirements, the width and design of stairs, the dimensions of corridors, fire suppression systems, and many other standards.</p>


        <h4 class="section_h4">Severe Storms / Flooding</h4>
        <p>This is the most common natural hazard in the United States, affecting over 20,000 local jurisdictions and representing more than 70 percent of Presidential Disaster Declarations.</p>
        <p>Factors that can affect the frequency and severity of flooding and the resultant types of damage include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Channel obstructions due to fallen trees</li>
            <li>Accumulated debris and ice jams</li>
            <li>Culvert openings that are insufficient to move floodwaters</li>
            <li>Erosion of shorelines and stream banks</li>
            <li>Deposition of sediment that is carried inland by wave action</li>
            <li>Dam and levee failure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Site Environment</h3>
        <p>These types of policies and protocols should support a safe environment and orderly procedures during emergencies.  Determine who is responsible for overseeing violence prevention strategies in the school and disseminate information to staff regarding the early detection of potentially dangerous behaviors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct an assessment to determine how the school environment may impact its vulnerability to certain types of crises</li>
            <li>Review incident data and determine how the school will address major problems with regard to student crime and violence</li>
            <li>Provide staff training on identification of risk and protective factors to help students</li>
            <li>Link prevention and intervention programs to community resources, including health and mental health</li>
            <li>Develop strategies for improving communication and students and between students and staff</li>
            <li>Provide safe and confidential ways for students to report potentially violent incidents</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="section_h2">Conducting Site Hazard Assessments</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Hazard Assessment Schedule</h3>
        <p>Each year, prior to the arrival of the instructional staff and students, the site administrator  and/or designee should undertake a physical survey of all hazards likely to be encountered in the evacuation routes from classrooms and other activity rooms to safe, open-space areas.</p>
        <p>During the first month of the educational year, each instructor should conduct a classroom hazard assessment to be submitted to the site administrator.</p>
        <p>The purpose of these hazards assessments is to identify and report for correction any existing conditions that pose potential risk to the occupants of the facilities.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">The Hazard Assessment Team</h3>
        <p>The Hazard Assessment Team should be a diverse group of people concerned with the safety of the school.</p>
        <p>An ideal group might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building site Supervisor</li>
            <li>Site Administrator</li>
            <li>Local Fire Official or Civil / Structural Engineer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optional group members may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instructor</li>
            <li>Student</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Preparing for a Hazard Assessment</h3>
        <p>Prior to conducting a hazard assessment/site safety audit, the team members should review the Site Emergency Management Plan, floor plan of the site , school accident and incident data and prior assessment reports <strong>at the beginning and at the end of the educational year.</strong>   A proactive process will help maintain a safe and secure learning environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather information about the facility, such as maps and the location of utility shutoffs</li>
            <li>Connect with community emergency responders to identify local hazards</li>
            <li>Review the prior safety audit to examine buildings and grounds</li>
            <li>Conduct an assessment to determine how these problems and others may impact site vulnerability to specific crises</li>
            <li>Develop procedures for communicating with staff, students and the media</li>
            <li>Establish procedures to account for students during an event</li>
            <li>Identify the necessary equipment that needs to be assembled to assist staff in an emergency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Building Hazard Hunt</h3>
        <h4 class="section_h4">Purpose</h4>
        <p>The purpose of the hazard hunt is to identify any special circumstances which exist in the school or near the campus which present unique problems or potential risk to people or property.  A walk-through inspection of each area of the building should be conducted using the Site Safety/Hazard Checklist.</p>
        <p>The interior and exterior portions of the building and grounds should be assessed for potential hazards that may impact the site, staff, and students including the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classrooms and labs</li>
            <li>Corridors and roof access</li>
            <li>Workshops</li>
            <li>Offices</li>
            <li>Custodial closets</li>
            <li>Bathrooms</li>
            <li>Break rooms</li>
            <li>Storage rooms</li>
            <li>Parking areas</li>
            <li>Outside structures and fencing</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="section_h4">Possible Hazards</h4>
        <p>Hazards to look for during the hazard hunt may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proximity to toxic, flammable, corrosive, chemically reactive or other hazardous materials</li>
            <li>Proximity of high voltage power lines</li>
            <li>Proximity to earthquake fault lines</li>
            <li>Likelihood and possible effects of flooding, including proximity to creeks </li>
            <li>Likelihood of a wild land fire</li>
            <li>Likelihood of severe weather</li>
            <li>Hanging fixtures on ceilings, such as fluorescent lights</li>
            <li>Locations of windows, particularly those near doorways</li>
            <li>Stability of bookcases and shelving in classrooms </li>
            <li>Objects on shelves, cabinets and hanging on walls</li>
            <li>Stability of water heaters</li>
            <li>Security of AV equipment, computers, TV monitors, etc. from motion </li>
            <li>Impediments to evacuation and transportation</li>
            <li>Inadequate storage of chemicals and labeling on containers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Staff Skills Inventory for Emergency Planning</h2>
        <p>A Staff Skills Inventory will help administrators plan assignments to emergency teams.  A sample inventory is provided among the forms.  The information provided should identify the following areas in which members of the staff have training or expertise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First Aid / CPR / AED</li>
            <li>Hazardous Materials</li>
            <li>Emergency Medical</li>
            <li>Multilingual Fluency</li>
            <li>Search and Site Assessment</li>
            <li>Fire Fighting</li>
            <li>Media Relations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Special Needs Information</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of each semester, staff should provide to the administrative office the name(s) of students in the class who will require special assistance in the event of an emergency and the type of assistance needed.  A variety of emergency conditions which may alter needs (e.g., severe weather, evacuation, hazardous materials, etc.) should be considered.  Preparedness for students needing special assistance is addressed in more detail.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Visitor Screening Policy</h2>
        <p>A visitor-screening policy (described later in this section) should be developed with signage to direct school visitors to the sign-in area.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post signs at key arrival points directing all visitors to the entry door</li>
            <li>Pass visitors through an office or sign-in area that offers verbal and visual contact with staff or volunteers</li>
            <li>Ask all visitors to sign-in and provide them with an I.D. badge or other visitor pass
                Designate individuals to ask the person’s name, area or room to be visited, and nature of the visit
                </li>
            <li>If the visitor is new to the site or unsure of the room location, have a staff member meet or accompany him/her</li>
            <li>Direct visitors to return to sign out upon leaving the building</li>
            <li>Familiarize all staff with the visitor screening policy</li>
            <li>Encourage staff to question people in the building without a visitor pass and ask them to check in with the office before proceeding to the intended destination</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Reporting an Emergency</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Internal Emergency Alerts / Notifications</h3>
        <p>In the event of an emergency, the following tools and systems will be used to communicate emergency conditions to the staff and students of the JATC facility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice Evacuation Fire Alarm – this should not be followed during a site Lockdown status</li>
            <li>Fire Alarm – strobe light and temporal horn</li>
            <li>Site Security Alarm</li>
            <li>PA system announcements building wide - this should not be followed during a site Lockdown status</li>
            <li>Staff group text</li>
            <li>Lockdown communication – performed by JATC authorized personnel and/or First Responders by opening each door to an occupied space</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Calling 911</h3>
        <p>911 is a telephone number dedicated to calls for emergency assistance, such as a traffic accident, fires, paramedic service, crime in progress, bodily injury, imminent threat to life, or major property damage or loss.</p>
        <p>The 911 Dispatcher is a trained dispatcher who will prompt what additional information is needed, based on the type of emergency (e.g., what the scene looks like, number of injuries or deaths).  In order to complete an assessment on the telephone, the 911 Dispatcher may have many questions to ask depending upon the nature of the problem. It is very important for the dispatcher to obtain as much information as possible, in the interests of responder safety and to dispatch the correct level of medical response.</p>
        <p>The 911 Dispatcher may ask you to stay on the line until responders arrive.  This will assist the dispatcher in keeping the fire, police or rescue squad updated as the situation being reported unfolds.</p>

        <h4 class="section_h4">When Reporting an Emergency</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Remain calm and speak slowly and clearly while explaining the type of emergency you are reporting</li>
            <li>Provide your name, location of the incident and your location, if different from the scene of the emergency</li>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  Though the technology exists which presents address and phone number data immediately to the 911 Dispatcher it is not available in all locations.   The 911 Operator is trained to confirm and verify the phone number and address for EVERY call received.   The dispatcher will ask questions concerning the type of emergency being reported.   The answers you provide will be relayed to the responding emergency personnel.</p>
            <li>Answer all questions asked by the 911 Dispatcher, even those that seem repetitious</li>
            <li>Stay on the line while the 911 Dispatcher processes the call.  You may need to provide additional information or to receive instructions from the 911 Dispatcher.  Do not hang up until the Dispatcher says to do so</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="section_h4">When Using a Mobile (Cellular) Phone</h4>
        <p>911 calls from cellular phones are answered by a local agency.  It is important to know your cell phone number and to be aware of your surroundings so you can tell the dispatcher where you are.  Ideally, street names and addresses should be provided.  Since many cell phone calls are made from moving vehicles, callers should inform the dispatcher when they change locations.</p>
        <p>Time is of the essence.  Every 911 Operator knows that.  It hampers response when a 911 operator has to ask the caller for information several times over because he/she couldn't comprehend what was being said.  Try to be as calm as possible and speak slowly and clearly.  This ensures the 911 operator has the correct information the first time he/she asks for it.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Establishing Reliable Communication</h2>
        <p>Establishing reliable communication networks is critical for dealing effectively with an emergency or crisis. Timely contact with law enforcement and other public agencies is necessary for effective response.  Site staff members and students must be told what is happening and what to do.  Families of students and staff members must be informed about the situation, including the status of their student and or family member. Rumors must be quelled.  Lastly, providing proper communication with the media if they arrive on your site is important.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Terminology</h3>
        <p>One of the most important things to do is use common / simple terminology.  Response agencies will communicate more effectively with site if similar roles are described with similar wording.</p>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Technology</h3>
        <p>During an emergency, telephones and cell phones will only be used to report emergency conditions or to request emergency assistance.  In the event that telephone and/or electrical service are interrupted, other means must be relied upon to relay information.  A bullhorn and/or runners will be utilized within the site building or site grounds.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Communication Methods</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Standard Telephones</h3>
        <p>A standard telephone plugged into a standard jack may work even when the electrical power is off.  Designate a telephone number as a recorded “hot line” for family to call for information during emergencies.  The goal is to keep other telephone lines free for communication with first responders and others.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Mobile Telephones</h3>
        <p>These phones may be the only method working when electrical service is out; they are useful to administrators and staff who may be in route to or from a site.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Intercom System</h3>
        <p>Ideally, systems should include instructor-initiated communications with the office using a handset rather than a wall-mounted speaker.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Bullhorns and Megaphones</h3>
        <p>A battery-powered bullhorn or megaphone should be part of the site’s emergency toolbox to address students and staff who are assembling outside the site. Procedures governing storage and use will help ensure readiness for use.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Two-way Radios</h3>
        <p>Two-way radios provide a reliable method of communication between rooms and building at a single site.  Train all staff fully to operate the two-way radio.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Computers</h3>
        <p>A wireless laptop computer may be used for communication both within the facility and to other sites.  E-mail may be a useful tool for updating information for staff.  Post information such as site evacuation, closure or relocation on the home page of the JATC website.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Fax Machines</h3>
        <p>Possible uses include off-site accidents where lists of students and staff members involved, their locations, and needed telephone numbers can be quickly and accurately communicated.  Medical information, forms, and authorizations can be faxed and returned in emergencies.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Media Communications</h2>
        <p>Most news people are sensitive when reporting emergencies that occur in school settings and are interested in doing a reputable job.</p>
        <p>The following suggestions will promote clear communications with the media:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designate one area (on or off site) where media briefings can take place</li>
            <li>Instruct all staff to refer all information and questions to the designated person (Remind staff that only designated spokespeople are authorized to talk with news media)</li>
            <li>Insist that reporters respect the privacy rights of students and staff.  Answer questions within the limits of confidentiality</li>
            <li>Take initiative with news media and let them know what is or is not known about the situation</li>
            <li>Speak to reporters in plain English</li>
            <li>If the emergency is a death, Principal should consult with the deceased student/staff member’s family before making a statement about the victim</li>
            <li>If there is involvement with a criminal case, work in conjunction with law enforcement spokesperson</li>
            <li>When communicating, maintain a unified position and message; keep messages concise, clear, and consistent</li>
            <li>Don’t try to “kill” a story; don’t say “no comment;” don’t speculate; don’t pass blame</li>
            <li>Delay releasing information until facts are verified and the sites position is clear</li>
            <li>Assign sufficient staff to handle phones and keep a log of calls and personal contacts</li>
            <li>Express appreciation to all persons who helped handle the emergency</li>
            <li>Always provide a phone number to call for additional or updated information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Communication Preparation</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Staff Information and Tools</h3>
        <p>The JATC site staff will review and develop on an annual basis the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An emergency phone list to be kept next to each fixed phone within the facilities</li>
            <li>Provide an emergency contact phone list to each staff person</li>
            <li>All staff should have on “file” an emergency contact person listing – This information could be critical in an emergency involving them</li>
            <li>Cell phone and texting for all staff</li>
            <li>Use of a group texting messaging system that allows all parties to be notified and communicate with the entire Epoch team</li>
            <li>Create an Emergency related email address that is monitored</li>
            <li>Hand held portable radios with capacity to handle the mountain terrain. Seek out a vendor to provide for your particular needs. (Predetermine the critical staff; positions to have these radios assigned during an event.)</li>
            <li>Sign up for Nixle to receive alerts from your local agencies – text your ZIP CODE to 888777 for mobile alerts</li>
            <li>Purchase a megaphone to be used to make announcements in the event of a power outage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section_h3">Redundancy</h3>
        <p>It is important to have Redundancy in the JATC communication Systems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Landline phone – internet based phone</li>
            <li>Cell phones with car chargers and interior power cords</li>
            <li>Texting capability</li>
            <li>Sign up for Nixle – To receive alerts from your local agencies -text your ZIP CODE to 888777 for mobile alerts</li>
            <li>Internet emails</li>

    </div>
    <section id="section_recovery" class="full-plan_section">
        
        <h1 class="section_h1">Recovery</h1>
        <p>Recovery refers to the follow-up measures taken after a disaster to return the affected site back to normal operating conditions.  Recovery focuses on restoring the infrastructure of the school (utilities, phones, water) to service, re-establishing a sense of emotional safety and returning to the learning environment as quickly as possible after a crisis.  Recovery actions are generally begun as response activities diminish, but some activities (e.g., keeping track of personnel time) must be started simultaneously with response.  Recovery measures are designed to assist students and staff impacted by physical, psychological and emotional trauma following an event.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Impact Assessment</h2>
        <p>Once the safety and status of staff and students has been assured and emergency conditions have abated, assemble staff to support the restoration of the sites programs. Defining mission-critical operations and staffing will be a starting point for the recovery process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CONDUCT</strong> a comprehensive assessment of the event’s physical and operational effects.  Assess physical security, data access, and all other critical services (e.g., plumbing, electrical)</li>
            <li><strong>EXAMINE</strong> critical information technology assets and personnel resources and determine the impact on the facility for each asset and resource that is unavailable</li>
            <li><strong>DOCUMENT</strong> damage, lost equipment and resources, and special personnel expenses that will be required for Insurance and perhaps FEMA assistance claims</li>
            <li><strong>ADMINISTER</strong> Workers’ Compensation if claims arise that are on-the-job injuries</li>
            <li><strong>ARRANGE</strong> for ongoing status reports during the emergency to </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Estimate when the site program can be fully operational</li>
                <li>Identify special facility, equipment, and personnel issues or resources that will speed resumption of classes</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Resumption of Training</h2>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Re-entry Into the Facility</h3>
        <p>The site administrator is the individual responsible for authorizing re-entry into the facility. A damage assessment team should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey the site after a disaster</li>
            <li>Report findings to site administrator</li>
            <li>Ensure that timely and accurate data is received</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Re-entry should occur only after the site administrator has been assured by public safety officials and / or local contractors that the safety of the site has been restored.</strong></p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Relocation</h3>
        <p>In the event the site is damaged to the extent that all or a portion of it is uninhabitable until repairs are made, plans must be developed to address the relocation of educational services and staff to alternate facilities until repairs are made or the facility is rebuilt.</p>
        <h3 class="section_h3">Repairs and Construction</h3>
        <p>Any repairs and rebuilding of damage wrought by site violence or natural disaster must carefully consider the input and feelings of the victims. There is a strong and significant psychological connection to death sites that must run its full course and should never be discounted or ignored.  Making changes and reconstruction in and around death and injury sites requires a delicate balance with the need to resume normal activities.  The construction must be the result of careful and deliberate consultation with students and staff Action should never be rushed.</p>

        <h1 class="section_h1">Security Information</h1>
        <p>This facility is monitored by a series of video surveillance cameras both interior and exterior – these cameras are recorded and the video is maintained for a minimum period of time approximately 6 months.</p>
        <p>There are multiple live monitoring stations available and this is a web based system so it can be accessed from multiple locations if desired.</p>
        <p>The site also maintains a building alarm system that is monitored from an external source/ vendor.</p>
        <p>The building access system is both hard key and electronic access key card. Both of these systems should be reviewed bi-annually for changes in users and potential access threat elimination. The assignment of these access keys is monitored by the administrative staff.</p>
        <p>Vendors and contractors who are providing services to the facility are provided a temporary access key card to perform those services. These keys are available at the main reception desk and are verified and signed out to those individuals.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Limiting Building Access</h2>
        <p>This is an educational facility with students and staff accessing multiple locations within the site during normal operating hours. A limited number of access doors should be available during business hours for the students and staff to move freely about the site.  These doors should be monitored by staff on regular basis to assure access is not being compromised by others without the authority to be onsite.</p>
        <p>All doors to classrooms, labs, offices, storage areas and gathering locations should be secured when not in use.</p>
        <p>Regular security / visibility walks should be performed by the staff throughout the course of the normal operating day.</p>
        <p>During non-regular operating hours, weekends, and evening classes all access points to the facility should be limited and controlled to maintain building security.</p>
        <p>Before securing the facility after operations, perform a walk-thru of the facility.  Each area should be visually secured and doors should be locked.</p>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Site Security Assessments</h2>
        <p>Quarterly, a designated individual should perform a Site Security Assessment review.  This review should include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outside security / parking lot lighting</li>
            <li>Security camera functionality</li>
            <li>Perimeter fencing check</li>
            <li>Door locking functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section_h2">Threat Reporting</h2>
        <p>All threats should be taken seriously and reported.  If a threat is imminent, call 911 immediately.</p>
        <p>The JATC requires employees to report all threats or incidents of violent behavior which they observe or are informed about to the JATC site administrator. The site administrator should take the steps necessary to complete a “Threat Incident Report” as quickly as possible, including a private interview of the victim(s) and witness (s). The report will be used by the JATC to assess the safety of the workplace and to decide upon a plan of action.  Elements of the “Threat Incident Report” and any subsequent actions relating to the incident should be recorded in a tracking system for use by the site.</p>
        <p>The tracking system as well as all investigative files should be kept secure and maintained separately from other records.</p>
