            <!-- ADDITIONAL INFO - Earthquake -->
            <h5>Hazards and Cautions</h5>
            <p>The major threat of injury during an earthquake is from falling objects, glass shards and debris. Many injuries are sustained while entering or leaving buildings. Therefore, it is important to quickly move away from windows, free-standing partitions and shelves and take the best available cover under a sturdy desk or table, in a doorway or against an inside wall.   All other actions must wait until the shaking stops.  If persons are protected from falling objects, the rolling motion of the earth may be frightening but not necessarily dangerous.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Elevator should not be used</li>
                <li>Fire alarms or sprinkler systems may be activated by the shaking</li>
                <li>Stairways will need to be inspected for damage before they can be used</li>
                <li>The major shock is usually followed by numerous aftershocks, which may last for weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Announcement (if possible)</h5>
            <p>If possible, an announcement should be made over the public address system and by staff in classrooms. This announcement should be similar to the following:</p>
            <p class="announcement"><q>Attention please. We are experiencing an earthquake. For your protection, follow DROP, COVER and HOLD ON procedures. Get under a table or desk, away from windows and anything that could fall and hurt you. Hold that position until the shaking stops or until you receive further instructions.</q></p>

            <h5>Outside Building - Actions and Precautions</h5>
            <p>If outside the building when an earthquake occurs, follow the steps and precautions below:</p> 
            <h6>During the earthquake</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Move students away from buildings, trees, overhead wires and poles</li>
                <li>Make body as small as possible by</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dropping to knees</li>

                </ul>
                <li>Maintain position until shaking stops</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Remain in place for at least 20 seconds</li>
                <li>Relocate to the proper evacuation assembly area</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Evaluate the situation and take further action in accordance with the Evacuation Procedure</p>
            <h5>During Non-Operational Hours</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect building to assess damage and determine corrective actions</li>
                <li>Notify fire department and utility company of suspected breaks in utility lines or pipes</li>
